1. Check how to link the account for use
    login function is now working 

2. Learn how to scrape, and scrape the comments
    I'll scrape some random 100-200 comments first for some sample
    train the model on this data

    UPDATE : FINALLY GETTING COMMENTS LETS GO

    then use active learning to deal with uncertain samples

3. Not sure how the storage part will work
    just csv i guess

    UPDATE : I'LL SEE HOW TO MAKE A NEW CSV FILE

4. Sentiment analysis we'll try to do with either openai OR our own trained model if I can learn ML
    most probably i'll work on our own trained model
