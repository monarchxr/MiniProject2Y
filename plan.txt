1. Check how to link the account for use
    login function is now working 

2. Learn how to scrape, and scrape the comments
    I'll scrape some random 100-200 comments first for some sample
    train the model on this data
    then use active learning to deal with uncertain samples

3. Not sure how the storage part will work
    just csv i guess

4. Sentiment analysis we'll try to do with either openai OR our own trained model if I can learn ML
    most probably i'll work on our own trained model
