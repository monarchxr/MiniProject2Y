@adidasindia .. are you not paying your designers their dues ?  Been waiting for a 2 star jersey but not that huge stars and why is that white .. please just put the current t20 with 2 stars on stores. .. I would buy that . This doesn't deserve 2k,negative

Who is approving these designs..?!Unlike Adidas designs...All India jerseys have huge fonts with literally no designing.

This looks shit.. fire your design team now..

Please available travel jarsy of Indian cricket team
What about the match kit!? @adidasindia 😢
lol wut 😱
Test jersey par champions likh dia 😭
Why use test match white? India has never won the WTC 🤦🏽
2 star looking like 5!
😂😂😂 you expect that people will buy this??.... why don't you provide jerseys to differently abled indian cricket players??
Nice
We need that player version which they wore during marching celebrations
Does this signify test championship wins? Because it’s white

⭐️⭐️ over the BCCI logo would’ve been just fine compared to this nonsense design! Looks like a kid has designed it on MS Paint
Such a poor design.. you have already set high standards. You can do much better!
A local gully guy can design n print a lot better than this...adidas is just another MPL 😂
